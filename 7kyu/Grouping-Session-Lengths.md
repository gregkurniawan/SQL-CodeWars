### Description:
You are working for a company that provides a video streaming platform. They are interested in understanding the length of video streaming sessions their users have. To do this, they've collected data for each session and stored it in a PostgreSQL database.

### The database has a table called sessions with the following columns:
- session_id (integer): A unique identifier for each streaming session.
- length_seconds (integer): The length of the streaming session in seconds.
- Write a SQL query to count the number of sessions that fall within five-second intervals (e.g., 0-4, 5-9, etc.).

### Your query should return a result set with two columns:
- bucket (text): This represents the five-second interval. It should be a string in the format "start-end", where "start" is the beginning of the interval and "end" is the end of the interval. For example, a session length of 25 seconds should fall into the "25-29" bucket.
- count (integer): The number of sessions that fall within the interval represented by the bucket.

### So on the concrete example, for this sample dataset:
| session_id | length_seconds |
|------------|----------------|
|     1      |      25        |
|     2      |      453       |
|     3      |      27        |

### The result of the SQL query will be:
|  bucket  | count |
|----------|-------|
|  25-29   |   2   |
| 450-454  |   1   |

GLHF!

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT((length_seconds/5)*5,'-',(length_seconds/5)*5+4) bucket,
  COUNT(*) count
FROM sessions
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY MIN(length_seconds);
```
