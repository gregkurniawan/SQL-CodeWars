### Description

Let's consider a case where we have a students table and a courses table. The tables have the following structure:

### students:

| id  | name     | email               |
|-----|----------|---------------------|
| 1   | John     | john@example.com    |
| 2   | Sarah    | sarah@example.com   |
| 3   | Robert   | robert@example.com  |
...

### courses:

| id  | student_id | course_name | score |
|-----|------------|-------------|-------|
| 1   | 1          | Math        | 90    |
| 2   | 1          | Science     | 85    |
| 3   | 1          | Physics     | 92    |
| 4   | 1          | Literature  | 80    |
...

Your task is to write a SQL query that identifies the students who have the highest combined score in 'Math' and 'Science' and assigns each student a unique ordinal number (which we will call 'rank') based on their total score. The student with the highest combined score should receive a rank of 1. If students have the same total score, the student with the smaller student ID should receive the lower rank.

Your query should return the following columns:

- rank: The unique ordinal number
- student_id: The ID of the student
- name: The name of the student
- total_score: The total score of the student in 'Math' and 'Science'

The result should be ordered by the rank in asc order

Good Luck!

Desired Output
The desired output should look like this:

rank	student_id	name	total_score
1	28	Dr. Emelda Klocko	192
2	39	Eleonor Lynch	191
3	26	Jannet Schoen V	189
