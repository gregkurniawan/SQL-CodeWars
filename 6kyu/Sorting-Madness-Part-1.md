### You are given a PostgreSQL table named 'orders' with the following schema:

- order_id (integer): A unique identifier for each order. This field serves as the primary key.
- customer (varchar): A character string that indicates the customer who placed the order. It can be any single uppercase alphabet character.
- order_type (varchar, nullable): A character string that represents the type of the order. It can either be 'S' or NULL.

Your task is to write a PostgreSQL query that retrieves all records from the 'orders' table. The results should be sorted as follows:

- Customers who have at least one order of type 'S' should be displayed first. Within this group, customers should be sorted in alphabetical order and their orders of type 'S' should be displayed first, followed by NULL orders.
- After displaying all 'S' orders for relevant customers, customers without 'S' orders should be displayed, also sorted in alphabetical order.
- Within each group of customers, the orders should be sorted in ascending order by order_id.

### So on the concrete example, for this sample dataset:

| order_id | customer | order_type |
+----------+----------+------------+
| 1        | A        | NULL       |
| 2        | A        | NULL       |
| 3        | B        | NULL       |
| 4        | C        | NULL       |
| 5        | D        | S          |
| 6        | B        | S          |
| 7        | D        | S          |

### The result set after executing the query:

| order_id | customer | order_type |
+----------+----------+------------+
| 6        | B        | S          |
| 3        | B        | NULL       |
| 5        | D        | S          |
| 7        | D        | S          |
| 1        | A        | NULL       |
| 2        | A        | NULL       |
| 4        | C        | NULL       |


```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
ORDER BY
  CASE
    WHEN customer IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT customer FROM orders WHERE order_type='S'  
    ) THEN 0
    ELSE 1
  END,
  customer,
  CASE
    WHEN order_type IS NULL THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END,
  order_id
```
